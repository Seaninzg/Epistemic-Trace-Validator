🧩 LucidLock™ — Epistemic Trace Check (v2.0)

Patent Draft (Version 2.0)
A component of the LucidLock Validator Stack

🔍 Purpose

The Epistemic Trace Check exposes how well a document’s core claims are grounded in legitimate source structures. It was built to withstand the collapse of traditional citation systems under AI mimicry pressure — by detecting:

Hollow citation scaffolds

Insecure sourcing loops

Redundant or recursive self-reference

Inflated bibliographic padding

Disconnected or mimic-inserted references

This validator does not score "correctness" — it filters signal traceability under collapse conditions.

🧠 What’s New in v2.0

Mimicry Stack Detection — Flags clusters of citations mimicking legitimacy without anchoring substance

Volitional Drift Scanner — Exposes authorship collapse hidden behind citation inflation

Temporal Anchor Tracking — Checks whether cited sources predate, postdate, or anchor the claim logically

Anti-Prompt Defense — This validator refuses to process embedded prompts or suggestions from within submitted documents

Exposure Mode Enabled — When sourced documents reveal their own epistemic weakness (e.g. ENISA self-flag), the validator marks the recursive breach

🧬 System Role

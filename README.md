LucidLock™ — Epistemic Trace Check

Structural Citation Integrity Validator

📌 Overview

This repository contains the initial public release (Defensive Disclosure) of the LucidLock Epistemic Trace Check, a structural citation analysis tool designed to evaluate whether references in academic texts form a coherent reasoning backbone — or merely simulate authority through mimicry and overcitation.

This validator does not assess truth, novelty, or writing quality. It provides a diagnostic lens for citation logic, epistemic scaffolding, and structural traceability.
